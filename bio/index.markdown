<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;colinwoodforddesign.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;08&#47;mainbio.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-213 alignleft" title="mainbio" alt="" src="http:&#47;&#47;colinwoodforddesign.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;08&#47;mainbio.jpg" width="145" height="145" &#47;><&#47;a><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Colin Woodford<&#47;strong> was unaware of how far he would delve into a career in design when he discovered how fabrics were made at the age of 16 during a men&rsquo;s tailoring class. His fascination with fabrics led him down a path of Tailor &amp; Cutter honors classes, commercial art, and finally at the age twenty one in San Francisco where he furthered his apparel design education at the Pacific Fashion Institute.<&#47;span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Raised in Singapore by a Japanese mother and Eurasian father during a great time of cultural blending and modernization, &ldquo;Thinking globally is not a new phrase to me.&rdquo; says Colin, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s who I&rsquo;ve always been. Inspiration and a desire to create new things while melding many cultural influences naturally springs from such a rich and diverse background as mine.&rdquo;<&#47;span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Colin has lived and designed in New York, San Francisco, Italy, Hong Kong, Australia, and China. His prestigious work history and client list include companies such as Henry Grethel, Banana Republic, Country Road Australia, The Orvis Co., L.L. Bean, Woolrich, The North Face, Simms Fishing, Royal Robbins, JL Powell, Levi Strauss &amp; Co., Smith &amp; Hawken, Paul &amp; Shark, Head Sportswear, Inc., Nordstrom, and, J.C. Penney.<&#47;span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In 1998 Ermenegildo Zegna approached Colin asking him to create an active sportswear line that would adhere to the high standards and elegance that is Zegna. Colin&rsquo;s solutions Zegna Sport, pure elegance in design and function.<&#47;span></p>
