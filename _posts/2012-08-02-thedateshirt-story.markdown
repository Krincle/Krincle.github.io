<p><strong>Hey Men...this is what we really want you to wear......</strong></h3></p>
<h3>What is the Date shirt? An idea born from attraction? Pure passion?</h3><br />
How does a man attract a women?<br />
 Well, there is the pick up line, the set up from friends, online dating, the chance meeting...but, every now and then a little magic happens.</p>
<p>I met my husband on an airplane. Not your average jaunt. I travelled four times a year from New York to Hong Kong on Pan Am to create a designer line of cashmere for a contemporary New York designer. On one trip in the '80's, while sketching away on the 18 hour flight I noticed a guy two rows ahead of me sketching out similar design specifications. He had this shirt on. A few comments and cocktails ensued. We exchanged cards, parted ways, I was convinced I would never see him again.</p>
<p>A few weeks later he called. He was attending a menswear conference in New York.<br />
 &ldquo;I have to see you&rdquo;, he said.<br />
 The doorbell rang. This exotic handsome man stood before me wearing this cool printed shirt. The guy from the airplane. &ldquo;Hey, you look great&rdquo; I said.<br />
 &ldquo;I always make a new shirt,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know, if I really want to impress a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>27 years later the rest is history.</p>
