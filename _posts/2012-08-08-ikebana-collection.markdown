<p>After designing menswear for many years I wanted to create clothing that incorporated my diverse cultural background. My desire was to offer men more than traditional plaids, stripes, or a printed vacation shirt to wear for special occasions, entertaining, and romance.</p>
<p>My Great Grandfather traveled from England in the 1800's working as a merchant for the East India Company to India, Penang, and Singapore. My father married a woman from Japan hence I have always been exposed to an East West mix of culture through food, art, and music. I wanted to convey that essence of exotic mystery in my fabrics and prints.</p>
<p><strong>The Ikebana Collection</strong> is a tribute to my mother. At age six I was exposed to the art of Ikebana (the art of the arranged flower) and to her skill in cutting a flower and placement with one precise stroke into the vase. Her movements were graceful and I strove to capture that essence of effortless perfection. Each print took many hours of research and I enlisted a Sumi master to help me create each print. The prints have a hand drawn character instead of a computer generated look.</p>
<p>I invite you to view the collection at&nbsp;<a title="ColinWoodford.com" href="http://colinwoodford.com/" target="_blank">ColinWoodford.com</a> opening this January.</p>
