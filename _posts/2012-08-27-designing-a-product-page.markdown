<p>I wanted to create a great product page for the Date Shirts to compliment the color and style of the shirts and to give the customer a real feel for the product, even while shopping on the internet. By using custom color fonts, front - side - back shots, and thumbnails of the shirt details, plus a magic zoom tool, links to the size chart and packaging, the customer can easily access all the information needed for their purchase all on one page.</p>
