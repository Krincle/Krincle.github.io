<div class = "gallery2">
<p><strong>Design clothes that bring your brand to life:</strong> I design apparel inspired by your vision, your story, and your customer. I build your brand DNA into each product, from the overall concept down to the smallest details.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Steer you around the pitfalls:</strong> I leverage my technical expertise in fit, construction, and fabric development to efficiently work through manufacturing obstacles during all phases of design and production.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Get things done using the best global resources:</strong> IÊ¼m a people person, team leader, and have the ability to unite and manage creative forces. I bring valuable resources from years of building and maintaining relationships with factories, mills, and suppliers worldwide.</p>
