<p>As a Global Design Director with twenty eight years of experience in the men&rsquo;s apparel industry, I work with CEOs and Presidents of apparel companies to create entirely new brand labels, strengthen brand images, and diversify existing product lines on a global level.</p>
<p>I specialize in creating new lifestyle concepts, products, and menswear collections for brand name companies and start up companies.</p>
<p>Specialties</p>
<p>Design expertise across all menswear product categories especially outerwear and sweaters and creating entirely new lifestyle concepts. Extensive knowledge of quality global sourcing and exclusive fabric&#47;yarn development.</p>
<p>I create a tailored design process to help individual entrepreneurs and inventors realize their apparel product goals.</p>
<p>My unique background in art, design, textile, and men&rsquo;s tailoring gives me the ability to create hand drawn designs in perspective and proportion bringing the product to life with a personal non-digital touch. I give my clients &nbsp;the ability to &ldquo;see&rdquo; an accurate rendition of their product before it is produced.</p>
