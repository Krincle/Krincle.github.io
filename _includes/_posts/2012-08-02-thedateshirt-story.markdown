<h3><span style="color: #000000;">What is the Date shirt? An idea born from attraction? Pure passion?<&#47;span><&#47;h3><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">How does a man attract a women?<&#47;span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> Well, there is the pick up line, the set up from friends, online dating, the chance meeting...but, every now and then a little magic happens.<&#47;span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I met my husband on an airplane. Not your average jaunt. I travelled four times a year from New York to Hong Kong on Pan Am to create a designer line of cashmere for a contemporary New York designer. On one trip in the '80's, while sketching away on the 18 hour flight I noticed a guy two rows ahead of me sketching out similar design specifications. He had this shirt on. A few comments and cocktails ensued. We exchanged cards, parted ways, I was convinced I would never see him again.<&#47;span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">A few weeks later he called. He was attending a menswear conference in New York.<&#47;span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> &ldquo;I have to see you&rdquo;, he said.<&#47;span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> The doorbell rang. This exotic handsome man stood before me wearing this cool printed shirt. The guy from the airplane. &ldquo;Hey, you look great&rdquo; I said.<&#47;span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"> &ldquo;I always make a new shirt,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know, if I really want to impress a woman.&rdquo;<&#47;span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">27 years later the rest is history.<&#47;span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Be that man, the man with the date shirt.<&#47;strong><&#47;span></p>
